# 3D-animation-Card
using Html Css
We create a simple card-like structure with a front and a back side using HTML and CSS.

We apply a 3D effect using perspective on the body element to give depth to the card.

The .card element is styled with 3D transformations, and an animation (flip) is applied, which rotates the card between the front and back sides.

The .side elements represent the front and back sides of the card. backface-visibility: hidden is used to hide the back side when it's not visible.

The @keyframes animation flip smoothly transitions the card from its initial state to the flipped state and back.
